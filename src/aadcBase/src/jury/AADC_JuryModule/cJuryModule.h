/*! /brief cJuryModule
This filter is used by the jury to control the vehicles during the competition.
The Module sends samples to a driver module which has to be implemented by the teams but can be based on the Demo filters. The sent samples contain the tJuryStruct and are used to check or set the state of the cars. The struct is defined as following:
typedef struct
{
tInt8 i8ActionID;
tInt16 i16ManeuverEntry;
} tJuryStruct;

The i8ActionID contain one of the following actions:
•	isReady: The vehicle is asked if it is ready to start the maneuver given in i16ManeuverEntry.
•	start: After receiving this sample the car should start the maneuver given in i16ManeuverEntry. Before that the sample the same maneuver is asked if it is ready.
•	stop: After receiving this sample the car should stop the maneuver given in i16ManeuverEntry. If the car is in a different maneuver it should be stopped as well.

The output pin Emergency_Stop should be connected directly to the pin Emergency_Stop of the Arduino Actuator Filter. It forces the Speed Controller to be switched of immediately.

The struct tJuryStruct is defined in aadc_structs.h in src\aadcBase\include and the used enums are defined in juryEnums.h in src\aadcBase\include

In the upper part of the gui the user can send messages to car. If an maneuver file was loaded successfully you can select a section or an maneuver index and press on of the three buttons “Request State”, “Start” or “Stop” to transmit the corresponding sample to the vehicle.
The last received state from the driver is shown in the middle of the gui and also in a console view.
